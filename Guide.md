## Authentication System

### Firebase Authentication Integration

The system uses Firebase Authentication with the following features:

- **Email/Password Authentication:** Secure login system
- **Automatic User Documents:** User profiles created automatically in Firestore
- **Role-Based Access:** Admin and Employee roles with different permissions
- **Password Reset:** Email-based password recovery
- **Session Management:** Firebase handles token management and session persistence

### User Roles

#### Administrator

- Full system access
- Employee management capabilities
- Customer management across all areas
- Package and billing management
- System configuration access
- Analytics and reporting access

#### Employee

- Area-based customer access
- Limited to assigned areas only
- Customer management within assigned areas
- Billing access for assigned customers
- Service request creation
- Cannot access employee management or system settings

### Security Implementation

#### Production Firestore Rules

The system implements comprehensive security rules:

```javascript
// Role-based access control
function isAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && getUserDoc().data.role == "admin";
}

// Area-based access for employees
function canAccessArea(area) {
  let userData = getUserDoc().data;
  return (
    isAdmin() ||
    userData.collector_name == area ||
    (userData.assigned_areas != null && area in userData.assigned_areas)
  );
}

// Active user validation
function isActiveUser() {
  return isAuthenticated() && getUserDoc().data.is_active == true;
}
```

#### Key Security Features

- **Authentication Required:** All operations require valid Firebase Auth token
- **Role Validation:** Server-side role checking prevents privilege escalation
- **Area Restrictions:** Employees cannot access data outside assigned areas
- **Active User Check:** Deactivated users lose system access immediately
- **Default Deny:** Unlisted collections are automatically denied access

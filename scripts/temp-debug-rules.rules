// TEMPORARY DEBUG RULES - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
// These rules allow any authenticated user full access for debugging
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

// To use these temporary rules for debugging:
// 1. Save this content to firestore.rules (backup your current rules first)
// 2. Run: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
// 3. Test your app to see if the permissions error is resolved
// 4. If it works, the issue is with the security rules logic
// 5. Restore your proper security rules immediately after testing

// WARNING: These rules are NOT secure and should only be used for debugging!
// Anyone with authentication can read/write all data with these rules.

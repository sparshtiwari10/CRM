echo "1. Check if security rules are deployed:"

echo ""
echo "2. Check collections in Firestore:"
echo "   - Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/$PROJECT/firestore"
echo "   - Verify these collections exist:"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ users (with your user document)"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ packages (may be empty, but should exist)"
echo "     ‚Ä¢ customers (if you have customer data)"

echo "3. Quick fixes to try:"
echo "   a) Deploy the security rules:"
echo "      firebase deploy --only firestore:rules"
echo ""
echo "   b) Create a test package in Firestore console to initialize collection"
echo ""
echo "   c) Check your user document in Firestore:"

echo "       }"
echo "     }"
echo "   }"
echo "   ----------------------------------------"
echo "   ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: These rules allow any authenticated user full access!"
echo "   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Only use for debugging, then restore proper security rules!"

echo "5. Check authentication in browser console:"
echo "   - Open browser dev tools"
echo "   - Check if user is logged in and has proper role"
echo "   - Look for any authentication errors"

echo ""
echo "üìû If issues persist:"
echo "   1. Share the Firebase project console screenshots"
echo "   2. Check browser console for detailed error messages"
echo "   3. Verify user document structure in Firestore"

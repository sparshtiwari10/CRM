/*
EMERGENCY ULTRA-SIMPLE RULES

These rules will resolve ALL permission issues immediately.

Why these work:
- No complex functions or logic
- No user document lookups
- No collection existence checks
- Simple authentication check only

Security Note:
These rules allow any authenticated user full access.
Use for debugging and initial setup only.

After the website works:
1. Verify all collections exist
2. Create proper admin user documents
3. Replace with secure role-based rules

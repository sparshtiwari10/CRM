/*
THESE ARE EMERGENCY RULES TO GET THE WEBSITE WORKING!

Why these rules work:
- Simple authentication check only
- No complex user document lookups
- No collection existence checks
- No complex field validations

TO USE:
1. Deploy these rules: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
2. Test website - it should work now
3. Once working, replace with proper security rules gradually

SECURITY NOTE:
These rules allow any authenticated user full access to all data.
Use only for debugging and initial setup.
Replace with proper role-based rules immediately after testing.

### 2. **Add VC Button in VC Inventory**

**Status:** âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Add VC button not working
**Root Cause:** Missing `changeVCStatus` method in VCInventoryService
**Solution:**

- Added `changeVCStatus` method to `src/services/vcInventoryService.ts`
- Enhanced status change tracking with audit trails
- Fixed VC creation workflow

**Files Modified:**

- `src/services/vcInventoryService.ts` - Added missing `changeVCStatus` method

### 3. **Edit Customer Button**

**Status:** âœ… VERIFIED

**Problem:** Edit customer button not working
**Root Cause:** Functionality was actually working, but may have been affected by Firestore permissions
**Solution:**

- Verified `setEditingCustomer` logic is correct
- Enhanced error handling in customer update workflows
- Added proper state management

**Files Verified:**

- `src/pages/Customers.tsx` - Edit functionality is properly implemented
- `src/components/customers/CustomerModal.tsx` - Modal integration working

### 4. **Enhanced Invoice System**

**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**Problem:** Missing "Create Invoice" button and proper `/invoices` collection structure
**Solution:**

- Complete rewrite of `src/pages/Invoices.tsx` with proper invoice modal
- Added "Create Invoice" button as requested
- Implemented `/invoices` collection with proper structure

## ðŸ§¾ **New Invoice System Implementation**

### **A. `/invoices` Collection Structure**

```typescript
interface PaymentInvoice {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  customerName: string;
  customerArea: string; // For area-based access control
  billId?: string; // Optional link to specific bill
  amount: number; // Same as amountPaid for compatibility
  amountPaid: number;
  paymentMethod: "cash" | "online" | "cheque" | "bank_transfer";
  paymentDate: string;
  paidAt: Date;
  collectedBy: string;
  notes?: string;
  receiptNumber: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### **B. Enhanced Invoices Page**

**File:** `src/pages/Invoices.tsx`

**New Features:**

#### âœ… **"Create Invoice" Button**

- Prominent green button in page header
- Opens comprehensive invoice creation modal
- Follows the design pattern mentioned in Guide.md

#### âœ… **Invoice Creation Modal**

**Modal Fields (as requested):**

- **Select customerId** - Dropdown with all customers showing outstanding amounts
- **Enter amountPaid** - Numeric input with validation
- **Choose paymentMethod** - Dropdown: cash, online, cheque, bank_transfer
- **Optional: Link to specific bill** - Dropdown of customer's unpaid bills
- **Notes** - Optional textarea for additional information

#### âœ… **After Invoice Creation**

**Automatic Actions:**

- Recalculates customer outstanding: `currentOS = (sum of unpaid bills) - (sum of payments)`
- Updates customer record with new outstanding amount
- Generates unique receipt number
- Creates audit trail with collection timestamp

#### âœ… **Enhanced Features**

- **Dual Tab Interface:**
  - "Invoice History" - View all payment transactions
  - "Outstanding Collection" - Quick payment for customers with dues
- **Smart Outstanding Detection** - Shows customers with pending amounts
- **Real-time Statistics** - Today's collection, monthly totals, collection rates
- **Search & Filtering** - By customer, receipt number, date ranges

### **C. PaymentService Enhancements**

**File:** `src/services/paymentService.ts`

**Added Methods:**

```typescript
static async createPayment(paymentData): Promise<string>
// Creates new invoice with proper Firestore integration
// Handles receipt number generation
// Updates collection timestamps
```

## ðŸ”„ **Outstanding Calculation Logic**

### **Formula Implementation:**

```typescript
currentOS = (sum of unpaid bills) - (sum of payments)
```

### **Update Triggers:**

1. **When Invoice Created:**

   - Fetch customer's current outstanding
   - Subtract payment amount
   - Update customer record immediately

2. **When Bill Generated:**

   - Add bill amount to customer outstanding
   - Set `previousOS = currentOS`
   - Calculate new `currentOS`

3. **Real-time Calculation:**
   - Invoice page shows live outstanding amounts
   - Customer page reflects updated balances
   - Bill generation considers current outstanding

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Status**

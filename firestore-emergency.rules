2. COPY THESE EMERGENCY RULES:
   cp firestore-emergency.rules firestore.rules

3. DEPLOY EMERGENCY RULES:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

4. TEST YOUR WEBSITE:
   - If it works: The issue was with security rules
   - If it still doesn't work: The issue is elsewhere (auth, collections, etc.)

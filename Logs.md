#### **Firestore Undefined Field Error RESOLVED**

- **Date**: Current Session
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Problem**: Firestore error when submitting requests: "Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field requested_plan)"
- **Root Cause**: `requested_plan` field being set to `undefined` for activation/deactivation requests (only needed for plan_change requests)
- **Firestore Rule**: Firestore doesn't accept `undefined` values in documents
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `firestoreService.addRequest()` method to handle undefined values properly
  - Added conditional inclusion of `requested_plan` field only when it has a valid value
  - Implemented proper data sanitization before sending to Firestore
  - Updated ActionRequestModal to only include `requestedPlan` for plan_change actions
- **Technical Details**:

  ```typescript
  // Before (problematic):
  requested_plan: request.requestedPlan, // Could be undefined

  // After (fixed):
  if (request.requestedPlan && request.requestedPlan.trim() !== "") {
    requestData.requested_plan = request.requestedPlan;
  }
  ```

- **Additional Safeguards**: Added comprehensive data sanitization using existing `sanitizeFirestoreData()` method

- **Date**: Current Session
- **Type**: Feature Enhancement & Bug Fix
- **Problems**:
  1. "Submit Request" button not working in employee request form
  2. No customer selection available in request form - admins couldn't identify which customer request was for
  3. Employee dashboard showing system-wide collections instead of employee-specific data
- **Root Causes**:
  1. ActionRequestModal expecting wrong props (`customer` & `onSubmit` vs `customers` & `onSuccess`)
  2. Missing customer selection functionality in request form
  3. Dashboard loading all customers for both admin and employee users
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - **Request Form**: Complete rewrite of ActionRequestModal component

    - Fixed prop interface to match usage in RequestManagement

#### **React setState During Render Warning RESOLVED**

- **Date**: Current Session
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Problem**: React warning "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" in ActionRequestModal
- **Root Cause**: `form.reset()` being called directly during component render phase
- **Location**: `src/components/customers/ActionRequestModal.tsx` line 95-97
- **Solution**:
  - Moved form reset logic from render phase to `useEffect` hook
  - Prevented setState calls during component rendering

- **Problem**: Multiple Firestore query failures requiring composite indexes:

  - Employee billing: "failed to load billing records" error
  - Employee requests: potential query failures
- **Root Cause**: Firestore composite index requirement when using `where()` + `orderBy()` in queries
- **Solution**:
  - **Customers**: Removed `orderBy("name")` from employee customer queries

  - **Requests**: Removed `orderBy("request_date", "desc")` from employee request queries
  - Added in-memory sorting after data retrieval for all employee queries

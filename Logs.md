#### **React setState During Render Warning RESOLVED**

- **Date**: Current Session
- **Type**: Bug Fix
- **Problem**: React warning "Cannot update a component while rendering a different component" in ActionRequestModal
- **Root Cause**: `form.reset()` being called directly during component render phase
- **Location**: `src/components/customers/ActionRequestModal.tsx` line 95-97
- **Solution**:
  - Moved form reset logic from render phase to `useEffect` hook
  - Prevented setState calls during component rendering
  - Maintained same functionality while following React best practices
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added `useEffect` dependency on `[open, defaultActionType, form]`
